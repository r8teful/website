    <p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Rik Muijs, otherwise known as r8teful, I was born in The Netherlands on August 1999 and moved to Sweden at age 6. My interests are in game development and content creation. I&rsquo;m currently studying at Chalmers University for my Computer Science degree with a master in Interaction Design and Technologies with specialization in Game development. I love creating games and videos for people enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I have been into computers as far back as I can remember. There are very old pictures of me in front of the computer where I couldn&rsquo;t even hold the mouse with one hand. When I was around 13 I was also really into video games, this is where I got introduced to some of my favorite games like Far Cry 3 and GTA (As well as a bunch of browser games). At around 16 I got into FPS games like CS:GO and H1Z1, and probably played them more than I should have. I reached the highest rank in CS:GO you could achieve (Global Elite) in December of 2017. Then, when I was 18, the same year as my graduation, Fornite&rsquo;s Battle Royale mode launched which I also played more then I should have. I made a conscious decision to put 70% into my Fortnite career, 10% on my personal health and about the other 20% on my studies, this meant I had 0% left for other stuff like socializing, which as a result left me with little to no friends. Let&rsquo;s say I was dedicated in this game for sure, all the way up to my 2nd year of University I probably played more then 10 hours daily, I have a total of 4400 hours played to this day. But those hours spent didn&rsquo;t all go to waste, I won some prize money from <a href="https://fortnite-esports.fandom.com/wiki/R8teful">Fortnite tournaments</a> and gained a decent following on my social media accounts. I also made some amazing friends along the way and learned some of the most valuable life lessons I know to date.</p>
<p>But all stories must come to an end, I probably had to make one of the biggest decision I had to make in my life, as you might know, spending only 20% on my studies came with a cost. As I was approaching my third year I had only passed about 60% of my courses with minimal grades, I either had to try to hold on a bit longer with my Fortnite career and ditch my studies completely, or quit Fortnite completely to focus on my studies and complete them in a reasonable timeframe. As you might have guessed, <a href="https://twitter.com/r8teful/status/1274725756044787712">I chose the latter</a></p>
<p>Ever since then I have put all my focus on the things that will put be closer to my goal: To become a successful Game Developer.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-into-video-editing">How I Got Into Video Editing</h2>
<p>Way back in 2012 I made my first public <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QY7gvzdhXY">YouTube video</a>. I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing at the time (I was only 13 after all). But there was some spark inside of me that got me into video editing, I would make many silly videos about my friends and share them around at school. I was the dedicated editor for my Highschool class and we won 1st place for our compilation videos. As a result I got praised as the class &ldquo;MVP&rdquo;. I also made a bunch of highlight videos from my best clips in my gaming &ldquo;career&rdquo;.<br>
I now make edits about the games I make and try to make them as enjoyable and informative to watch!</p>
