      <description>Who am I again? Hi and welcome to my very inconsistent blogging life! Today I will again share with you my thoughts and what has been going on with my life, but trust me, this post is the best one yet! (probably not true). I have been on my own again and for some reason this sparks my inner productivity beast that just wants to keep working, this is one of the reasons Iâ€™m writing here again, also for another reason I will discuss later.</description>

      <description>The Last Year A lot of things have happened since I last wrote something on this blog more then a year ago now. I spent half of that year abroad in Utrecht, The Netherlands where I met lots of cool people and socialized a lot. I also spent time traveling to various places inside Europe, one of being Antwerp where I watched the CS:GO Major which was one of the most enjoyable events I have been to.</description>

      <description>Hey! This is the start of my personal blogging journey. I have been interested in documenting my personal development ever since I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just play video games all day without any effort (which was about 3 years ago when I turned 18). Ever since then I&amp;rsquo;ve made different notes on different note taking apps and documents scattered all over the place. But I have not really had a specific spot for these things.</description>
