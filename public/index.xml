      <description>Hey! This is the start of my personal blogging journey. I have been interested in documenting my personal development ever since I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just play video games all day without any effort (which was about 3 years ago when I turned 18). Ever since then I&amp;rsquo;ve made different notes on different note taking apps and documents scattered all over the place. But I have not really had a specific spot for these things.</description>
