    <p>Hey! This is the start of my personal blogging journey. I have been interested in documenting my personal development ever since I realized I couldn&rsquo;t just play video games all day without any effort (which was about 3 years ago when I turned 18). Ever since then I&rsquo;ve made different notes on different note taking apps and documents scattered all over the place. But I have not really had a specific spot for these things.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-this-blog">The Idea Of This Blog</h3>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not planning on bombarding this blog with a bunch of useless content, instead, I&rsquo;ll be focusing on writing things here that are within my own niche, which mainly for now is: <strong>indie game development.</strong> I have already made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRu3mbM6-lIhLAp2VHe_4TIb-xgm77CdZ">handful of games</a> and planning on making a lot more. I&rsquo;d usually just make a silly video of the development process, but I&rsquo;d also like to make more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and informative blogposts about them to highlight some of the technical details if there are any interesting things to highlight of course, I&rsquo;ll also plan to keep track of my games in one big devlog post, similar to how a327ex had done with the creation of <a href="https://github.com/a327ex/SNKRX/blob/master/devlog.md">SNKRX</a>. I might also make some related posts about other stuff that interests me, like art, video editing etc&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-goal-of-this-blog">The Goal Of This Blog</h3>
<p>The goal of these blog posts is mainly for me to put down the information I know on paper for the rest of the world to take in and hopefully learn something useful out of. This way I improve my own skills in expressing the things I want to convey in words and thus get a deeper understanding in them. As well as you, the reader, gets to hopefully leave more knowledgeable compared to when they clicked on the post. And of course, I will have a bunch of logs to look back on in 10 years and say to myself &ldquo;Damn, look how far I have come&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="final-words">Final Words</h3>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s basically all I had to say for this first blog post. I will most likely be making a YouTube video about how I went about to make this website.</p>
<p>Take care and stay safe.</p>
