## About

Hi! I'm Rik Muijs, otherwise known as r8teful, I was born in The Netherlands on August 1999 and moved to Sweden at age 6. My interests are in game development and content creation. I'm currently studying at Chalmers University for my Computer Science degree with a master in Interaction Design and Technologies with specialization in Game development. I love creating games and videos for people enjoy.

## Background

I have been into computers as far back as I can remember. There are very old pictures of me in front of the computer where I couldn't even hold the mouse with one hand. When I was around 13 I was also really into video games, this is where I got introduced to some of my favorite games like Far Cry 3 and GTA (As well as a bunch of browser games). At around 16 I got into FPS games like CS:GO and H1Z1, and probably played them more than I should have. I reached the highest rank in CS:GO you could achieve (Global Elite) in December of 2017. Then, when I was 18, the same year as my graduation, Fornite's Battle Royale mode launched which I also played more then I should have. I made a conscious decision to put 70% into my Fortnite career, 10% on my personal health and about the other 20% on my studies, this meant I had 0% left for other stuff like socializing, which as a result left me with little to no friends. Let's say I was dedicated in this game for sure, all the way up to my 2nd year of University I probably played more then 10 hours daily, I have a total of 4400 hours played to this day. But those hours spent didn't all go to waste, I won some prize money from [Fortnite tournaments](https://fortnite-esports.fandom.com/wiki/R8teful) and gained a decent following on my social media accounts. I also made some amazing friends along the way and learned some of the most valuable life lessons I know to date.

But all stories must come to an end, I probably had to make one of the biggest decision I had to make in my life, as you might know, spending only 20% on my studies came with a cost. As I was approaching my third year I had only passed about 60% of my courses with minimal grades, I either had to try to hold on a bit longer with my Fortnite career and ditch my studies completely, or I quit Fortnite completely to focus on my studies and complete them in a reasonable timeframe. As you might have guessed, [I chose the latter](https://twitter.com/r8teful/status/1274725756044787712)

Ever since then I have put all my focus on the things that will put be closer to my goal: To become a successful Game Developer.

## How I Got Into Video Editing
Way back in 2012 I made my first public [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QY7gvzdhXY). I didn't really know what I was doing at the time (I was only 13 after all). But there was some spark inside of me that got me into video editing, I would make many silly videos about my friends and share them around at school. I was the dedicated editor for my Highschool class and we won 1st place for our compilation videos. As a result I got praised as the class "MVP". I also made a bunch of highlight videos from my best clips in my gaming "career".\
I now make edits about the games I make and try to make them as enjoyable and informative to watch!
